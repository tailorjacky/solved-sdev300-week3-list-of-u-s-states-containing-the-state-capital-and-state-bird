This lab consists of two parts.

The first exercise  allows a user to display, sort and update as needed a List of U.S States containing the State Capital and State Bird. The Internet provides multiple references with these lists. For example: <a href="https://www.crestcapital.com/tax/us_states_and_capitals">https://www.crestcapital.com/tax/us_states_and_capitals</a> <a href="http://www.thewebmap.com/FiftyStates/">http://www.thewebmap.com/FiftyStates/</a>

You will need to embed the State data into your Python code. The user interface will allow the user to perform the following functions:

<ol>

 <li>Display all U.S. States in Alphabetical order along with Capital and Flower</li>

 <li>Search for a specific state and display the appropriate Capital and Bird</li>

 <li>Update a Bird for a specific state</li>

 <li>Exit the program</li>

</ol>

As before, generate an appropriate Welcome, prompt, and exit messages to help the user navigate the program.

The program should continue to allow selections until the program is exited.

If a state is not found an appropriate message should be displayed.

Hints:

<ol>

 <li>Use the List data structure and associated sort() and searching capabilities</li>

 <li>Create and use functions as often as possible</li>

 <li>Use comments to document your code</li>

</ol>

For the second exercise determine the union, intersection and difference of the square and cube of integers ranging from 1 to 100. Sets are clearly the way to go here. You can use Math functions to generate the sets for the square and cube for the Integers.

The following functionality should be available for the user via a simple interface:

<ol>

 <li>Display the Square and Cube for Integers ranging from 1 to 100</li>

 <li>Search the sets for a specific Integer and display the Square and Cube values</li>

 <li>Display the Union of Square and Cube sets</li>

 <li>Display the Intersection of Square and Cube sets</li>

 <li>Display the Difference of Square and Cube sets</li>

 <li>Exit the program</li>

</ol>

If an Integer is not found an appropriate message should be displayed The program should continue to allow selections until the program is exited.

Hints:

<ol>

 <li>Use Sets and their associated union(), interaction() and difference() methods</li>

 <li>Create and use functions as often as possible</li>

 <li>Use comments to document your code</li>

</ol>

3. Document your results for each application within the AWS Cloud9 classroom environment.  Provide screen captures and descriptions for each test cases you provide for each of your applications. Be sure to go through each possible user interface combination in your test cases.<strong> </strong>
